# Super Shot Zone [GMTK 2019 Game Jam]

A game made within 4-5 hours for the [2018 GMTK game jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2018), the theme was "Only One". 

The Jam technically lasted 48 hours, but I didnt have as much free time this year. So I had to try I make what I could in a couple of hours,
hence the basic gameplay/messy code.

Super Shot Zone is a action platform game where you have to try and defeat as many enemies as possible, only one need's to reach the end and it's game over.

You can play the game online here: https://danielgriffiths.itch.io/super-shot-zone (this build is from the time of the game jam)
